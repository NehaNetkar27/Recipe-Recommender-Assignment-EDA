OBJECTIVE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT 


If you visit any recipe websites, let’s say food.com, for example, you will notice a section called “You’ll also love.” Under this section, the website recommends recipes related to the one you are looking at or based on your past rating patterns. Our job is to design a recommender system to recommend recipes to users based on their choice and the current recipe they are looking at. 
In this assignment we have to use AWS EMR to work on BigData to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and feature extraction from the raw data.

Conclusion.....

In this analysis of recipe data shows that the review time since submission and the number of steps, preparation time and number of ingredients are important factors in determining the rating of a recipe.
Recipes that are reviewed by users after a long time from the submission date, have less number of steps, less preparation time and less number of ingredients tend to have high ratings of 5. 
In contrast, the number of ingredients in a recipe is not found to be relevant to the rating. Similarly, the nutrition columns such as calories, fat, sugar, sodium, protein, and fat. and per serving are not found to be relevant in determining the rating of a recipe. 
The findings of this analysis can be used to inform decisions about recipe development and presentation to users in order to meet their preferences
